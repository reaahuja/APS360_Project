The relevant files with results are as follows: 
* `modelruns.ipynb` - contains the primary model
* * `baselinemodel.ipynb` - contains functions for preprocessing and the baseline model
* `testing.ipynb` - contains functions to import HIBA test dataset and evaluate the best model on the new data
  
Preprocessed images were downloaded after running functions in a Google Colab notebook, located [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XqBiA8LButjDnEbptTXUhJLl129Eed09?usp=sharing)
